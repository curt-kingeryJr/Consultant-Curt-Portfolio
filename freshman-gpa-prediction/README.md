# Predictive Analytics: Applying Linear Regression

## Overview  
This project demonstrates my ability to use **predictive analytics and statistical modeling** to solve a real-world business problem. I applied **linear regression** using R’s `tidyverse` and related packages to identify key factors influencing a target outcome, quantify their impact, and predict future performance.  

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation** – Importing raw data, handling missing values, transforming variables for analysis.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualizing relationships, identifying patterns, and summarizing statistical trends.  
- **Predictive Modeling** – Applying and interpreting multiple linear regression to quantify relationships between variables and predict outcomes.  
- **Model Evaluation** – Assessing model fit, checking assumptions, and validating performance.  
- **Business Insight Generation** – Translating statistical results into actionable recommendations.  

## Why It’s Relevant  
This project showcases my ability to move from raw data to a statistically valid predictive model while maintaining a focus on **practical, decision-ready insights**. It reflects the type of analysis I would bring to any role requiring **data-driven forecasting, performance improvement, or operational planning**.
