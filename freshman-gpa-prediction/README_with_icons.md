# 📊 Predictive Analytics: Linear Regression

## 🔍 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates my ability to **apply machine learning techniques**—specifically, linear regression—to predict future outcomes based on historical data. The analysis focuses on building a model, validating it, and interpreting the results to provide clear, actionable insights.

## 🎯 Key Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Preparation & Cleaning** 🧹 – Handling raw data, managing missing values, and preparing features for modeling.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 📈 – Identifying trends, relationships, and potential predictors.  
- **Model Development** 🤖 – Using R's `tidyverse` and statistical modeling functions to train a linear regression model.  
- **Performance Evaluation** 📊 – Interpreting R², p-values, residuals, and other metrics to validate model accuracy.  
- **Business Context Translation** 🗣 – Communicating results in plain language for decision-making.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** R  
- **Libraries:** tidyverse, broom, ggplot2  
- **Techniques:** Linear Regression, Data Visualization, Feature Engineering

💡 **Why This Matters for Employers**  
This project highlights my ability to transform raw datasets into predictive models that can guide strategic decisions. Recruiters and hiring managers can expect that I not only build accurate models but also communicate findings effectively for non-technical audiences.
