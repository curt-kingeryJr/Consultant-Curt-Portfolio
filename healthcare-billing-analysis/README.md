# Healthcare Data Analytics Portfolio

This project demonstrates core data analysis, visualization, and
automation techniques applied to a **sterile healthcare dataset**.\
The goal is to showcase analytics workflows that can be safely shared
without exposing sensitive patient or facility information.

## Project Overview

-   **Dataset:** A sanitized workbook representing healthcare operations
    data.\
-   **Tools Used:** Excel, Power Query (`query.m`), and Power BI
    concepts.\
-   **Focus Areas:**
    -   Data cleaning and transformation
    -   Performance metrics development
    -   Visualization and dashboard reporting
    -   Automation concepts for recurring reporting

## Key Features

1.  **Data Transformation:**\
    Used Power Query to reshape raw data into structured tables ready
    for analysis.

2.  **Analytics & Metrics:**\
    Calculated KPIs such as utilization rates, supplier reliability, and
    order aging.

3.  **Visualization:**\
    Demonstrated use of pivot tables, charts, and Power BI-ready data
    models.

4.  **Automation:**\
    Applied repeatable ETL processes via `query.m` to reduce manual
    effort.

## Files in Repository

-   **README.md** -- Overview of project and documentation.\
-   **query.m** -- Power Query M script used to transform the dataset.\
-   **healthcare_dataset.xlsx** -- Sterile practice dataset used for the
    analysis.

## Purpose

This portfolio example highlights how **federal healthcare supply chain
operations** can benefit from structured data workflows.\
The emphasis is on **completeness, accuracy, and repeatability**---key
to supporting informed decisions at scale.
